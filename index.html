    <h3 id="heading-item">Keyboard</h3>
    <p>
        I have a gaming keyboard. It is from razer. It is a Blackwidow Chroma version. It has a perfect size. It's led options are fantastic. It has it's own app dedicated to colors. You can make 16.8 million combinations of colors. It does not have a
        handrest. It has razer's own designed switches. They are as loud as cherry blue switches.

    <h3 id="heading-item">MousePad</h3>
    <p>
        I somehow have a "gaming" mousepad. It's from razer as well. It is the razer firefly, It also has a few RGB options. In my opinion, the best one is the rainbow wave. If you do not have interest in colors, <strong>DO NOT</strong> buy this.
        It does not cover the keyboard, But is still pretty big.
